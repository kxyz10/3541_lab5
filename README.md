## Point Breakdown
Interpolation: 4/4 points. We implemented interpolation using Catmull-Rom Spline

Reparameterization by Arc Length: 2/2 points. We make 10 evenly spaced arcs between each control point.

Ease In Ease Out: 2/2 points. The sphere accelerates for the first half of the time and then decelerates the other half.

Additional Work: 1/1 points. We display small circles as the sphere moves to each point on its overall curve. This allows the viewer to get a better idea of the path it took.

Documentation: 1/1 points. This README is the documentation.
